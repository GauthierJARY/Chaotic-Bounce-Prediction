### Introduction: Project on Study and Signal Processing of Ball Rebounds on a Vibrating Plate

This project focuses on studying the signals generated by the rebounds of a ball on a vibrating plate. The aim is to analyze these signals to understand the characteristics of the associated physical phenomenon of transition to chaos.
This project provides an opportunity to apply signal processing skills to the study of a real physical phenomenon. It allows for a deeper understanding of the complex signals generated by the rebounds of a ball on a vibrating plate leading to chaos through successive bifurcation.

Acquisition of signals using a laser camera.
The recorded signals include the movement of the vibrating plate and the oscillations of the ball.
Raw data is subject to noise and other imperfections.

### MATLAB Development:

MATLAB code is developed to process the experimental signals. Signal processing techniques are used to filter noise and extract relevant information. Signal processing parameters are adjusted to optimize data analysis.

**Data Analysis:**
Processed data is analyzed to identify important characteristics of the studied phenomenon. Statistical analysis tools can be used to quantify system properties. Each material properties eing different, several codes are used according to the type of material of the ball.
